# Spotify-Wrapper
 CS 2340 Project using spotify API 


#FrontEnd 
- cd to the frontend folder
- npm install
- npm run dev (to run the server)


#Backend 
- cd to the backend folder (do it in a seperate terminal)
-  pip install python-decouple (https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/)
-  ask Alberto for enviroment file (put that file into your backend folder (.env))
-  pip install djangorestframework (https://pypi.org/project/djangorestframework/)
-  python manage.py runserver (run the backend server)


You need to run these both servers at the same time, in order to work perfectly.
